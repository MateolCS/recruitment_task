In order to set up the project clone the repo using  `git clone` or download source code from above. Then open Your command line and go to the project directory and type `yarn install` to download all dependencies. You should also add a .env file with api url and name it REACT_APP_API_URL.

## To launch the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

It took me around 2h to perform the task.
